DESCRIPTION

Style the HTML Body Element
Now let's start fresh and talk about CSS inheritance.

Every HTML page has a body element.

We can prove that the body element exists here by giving it a background-color of black.

We can do this by adding the following to our style element:

body {
  background-color: black;
}

==================================================================
TESTCASE

Your body element should have the background-color of black.

Your CSS rule should be properly formatted with both opening and closing curly brackets.

Your CSS rule should end with a semi-colon.

SETUP

<style>

</style>

<style>
    body {
        background-color: black;
    }
</style>
