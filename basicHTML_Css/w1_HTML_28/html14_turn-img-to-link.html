DESCRIPTION

Turn an Image into a LinkPassed
You can make elements into links by nesting them within an a element.

Nest your image within an a element. Here's an example:

<a href="#"><img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="Three kittens running towards the camera."></a>
Remember to use # as your a element's href property in order to turn it into a dead link.

Place the existing image element within an a (anchor) element.

Once you've done this, hover over your image with your cursor. Your cursor's normal pointer should become the link clicking pointer. The photo is now a link.

==================================================================
TESTCASE

The existing img element should be nested within an a element.

Your a element should be a dead link with a href attribute set to #.

Each of your a elements should have a closing tag.
